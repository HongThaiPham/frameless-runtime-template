The assignment is broadly composed of the following parts:

* Basics: 1 point
* Currency: 1 point
* Tipping or Nonce: 1 point
* Staking: Optional
* 4th point is reserved for distinction.

**Please make sure you work on the above points in the given order**: First do the basics, then
currency, then tipping/and or nonce, and iff you have time left, staking.

### pre-grading

Create a branch in your repo called `pregrade`. Place a file called `runtime.wasm` in the root of
your file tree in this branch. This must be your runtime compiled with `--release`. Push this file.
Your results will be pushed back to the same branch.

Submission times:
	* Thursday 8pm
	* Friday 4pm, 8pm
	* Saturday 10am, 4pm

### final grading

Same as above, but don't create a new branch. Place `runtime.wasm` at the root of your `main` branch
and push it. Make sure to do this prior to the deadline.

Recall: Final deadline is Saturday 10pm.

Good luck!
