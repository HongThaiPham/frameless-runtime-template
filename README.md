# Frameless Runtime

Run `cargo doc -p runtime --open --document-private-items`, and start hacking ðŸš€

## How to Run

You can run this runtime with a custom minimal `omni-node` that is prepared for PBA.

First:

```
cargo install --force --git https://github.com/kianenigma/pba-omni-node
```

Then, you can run:

```
# build the wasm runtime, possibly with log targets.
RUST_LOG=frameless=info cargo build --release
# pass it to the node
RUST_LOG=frameless=debug
pba-omni-node
	# the path to the runtime.
	--runtime ./target/release/wbuild/runtime/runtime.wasm
	# ensures we spin up a new database each time.
	--tmp
	# tweak the blocktime, if you want.
	--consensus manual-seal-100
```

## Building a Chain Spec

TODO: install chain-spec-builder at the right polkadot-sdk version.

```
chain-spec-builder create
	--chain-name pba-frameless
	-r ./target/release/wbuild/runtime/runtime.compact.compressed.wasm
	default
```

And inspect the value. See how you can find a `value: 42` in there. This is the genesis part of your
chain-spec, generated by the runtime, in the default mode.

You can then run this with:

```
RUST_LOG=frameless=trace
	pba-omni-node
	--chain chain_spec.json
	--tmp
```

Notice how you can change the `value: 42` part and re-launch the chain.
